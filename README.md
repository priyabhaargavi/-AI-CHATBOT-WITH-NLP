This is an AI chatbot created with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning models. The chatbot is created to respond like a human by combining basic rule-based replies with a more sophisticated AI model. It first tests the user input against predefined replies and, if not, responds with a reply given by a transformer-based language model.

The chatbot employs the NLTK library for text processing such as tokenization and general NLP operations. For AI-generated responses, it is based on Microsoft's DialoGPT, a pre-trained conversational model. This enables the chatbot to offer more dynamic and contextually relevant responses. To ensure proper functioning, the chatbot also employs attention masking, which aids in dealing with padding tokens correctly during text generation.

To execute the chatbot, you must install some dependencies and run the script. After running, you can use the chatbot by sending messages. If there is a predefined reply available, the chatbot responds immediately; otherwise, it creates a response through AI. You can extend the chatbot further by incorporating more sophisticated models, fine-tuning with your own datasets, or even multilingual capabilities.

This project is an excellent starting point for anyone who is interested in developing AI-based conversational agents. It demonstrates the capabilities of deep learning and NLP in developing engaging chat applications. Feel free to customize and enhance the chatbot according to your requirements, whether for academic projects, automating customer service, or personal applications.
